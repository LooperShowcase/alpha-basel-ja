      On March 12, 1998, Take-Two Interactive announced its acquisition of the
      assets of dormant British video game publisher BMG Interactive from BMG
      Entertainment (a unit of Bertelsmann). In exchange, Take-Two was to issue
      1.85 million shares (around 16%) of its common stock to BMG
      Entertainment.[4][5] Through this acquisition, Take-Two obtained several
      of BMG Interactive's former intellectual properties, including DMA
      Design's Grand Theft Auto and Space Station Silicon Valley.[6][7] The deal
      was announced to have closed on March 25.[8] Three BMG Interactive
      executives—Dan Houser, Sam Houser, and Jamie King—as well as Gary Foreman
      of BMG Interactive and Terry Donovan of BMG Entertainment's Arista Records
      record label, subsequently moved to New York City to work for Take-Two
      Interactive.[6][9][10] In a restructuring announced that April, Sam Houser
      was appointed as Take-Two's "vice president of worldwide product
      development".[11] In December 1998, the Houser brothers, Donovan and King
      established Rockstar Games as the "high-end" publishing label of
      Take-Two.[6][12][13][14] The formation was formally announced on January
      22, 1999.[15] In January 2007, Take-Two announced that Donovan, until then
      managing director for Rockstar Games, had left the company following a
      four-month leave of absence.[16] He was succeeded by Gary Dale, who became
      chief operating officer.[17] Dale previously worked with the Houser
      brothers and King at BMG Interactive, but left the company when it was
      acquired by Take-Two Interactive, and joined Capcom's European operations
      as managing director in 2003.[18][19] As of February 2014, Rockstar Games
      titles have shipped more than 250 million copies,[20] the largest
      franchise being the Grand Theft Auto series, which alone has shipments of
      at least 250 million as of November 2016.[21] Grand Theft Auto V shipped
      the highest number of units within the series' and the company's history,
      with over 170 million copies,[22] making it the second best-selling video
      game of all time.[23] At the 10th British Academy Games Awards in March
      2014, Rockstar Games was honored with the BAFTA Academy Fellowship Award
      for "creating intricately layered interactive worlds that have kept the
      company at the forefront of the gaming industry for over a decade, both
      critically and commercially".[24][25] Jennifer Kolbe, who started at the
      front desk of Take-Two, acts as Rockstar Games' head of publishing and
      oversees all development studios.[2][26] Simon Ramsey is the company's
      head of PR and communications.[26] In May 2019, Rockstar Games announced
      that they were acquiring Dhruva Interactive from Starbreeze Studios for
      $7.9 million, with the sale being finalized later that month and the
      Dhruva team merged into Rockstar India.[27][28] In September 2019,
      Rockstar Games announced that they had released their own game launcher, a
      digital distribution, digital rights management, multiplayer and
      communications service.[29] After having taken an extended break following
      the release of Red Dead Redemption 2 in early 2019, Dan Houser left
      Rockstar Games on March 11, 2020.[30] The company acquired the Scottish
      studio Ruffian Games in October 2020, rebranding the studio as Rockstar
      Dundee. In September 2022, Rockstar was the target of a data breach in
      which 90 videos from the development of the upcoming Grand Theft Auto game
      were leaked.[32][33] Rockstar described the leak as a "network intrusion",
      and noted that it was "extremely disappointed" by the manner in which the
      game was first demonstrated, but that it did not anticipate long-term
      effects on development.
